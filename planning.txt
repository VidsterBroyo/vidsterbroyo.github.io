- can't explain but i like this aesthetic https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/475129266/8edcf81b-7620-4313-a5ed-b66ae51831a1

- marquee at the top, black all caps, random announcements
- no nav bar
- full size banner at the top
- with links to github/linkedin/stuffs
- pic of rubber duck - caption: my debugging partner in crime
- draggable pixelated stars for fun
- maybe a cool pop up welcome like from the catOS
- a chatgpt background asking for a description of me
- include gallery of projects - ooh a cool flip thing, you hover/click and it flips
- include link to resume

- CAS?
